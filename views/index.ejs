    	<article>The Character Building Tool, inspired by an 
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/david-brooks-the-mental-virtues.html" target="_blank">Op-Ed article</a> by New York Times 
    columnist David Brooks, can serve as a valued 
    companion in your quest for a rich and 
    "examined" life. It is designed to help you 
    periodically reflect on your own character in 
    terms of each virtue and guide you through 
    this process with questions pertaining to your 
    life. The app enables you record your answers 
    to these questions at a time interval of your 
    choosing (eg, on your birthday every year) 
    and also gives you the option to enter general 
    thoughts, including comparative assessments 
    of your answers over time, in the "life goals" 
    section. Our hope is that the Character 
    Building Tool will help you stay focused on 
    important and potentially life-changing goals. 
    Have fun!
